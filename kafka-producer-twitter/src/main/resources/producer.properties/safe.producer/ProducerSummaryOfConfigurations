Safe Producer

If we have kafka < 0.11 (producer level)
acks=all
    THis ensures that data i sproperly replicated before an ack is received

min.insync.replicas=2 (broker/topic level)
    Ensures two brokers in ISR at  least have the data after an ack

retries=max_INT (producer level)
    Ensures transient errors are retried indefinitely

max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=1 (producer level)
    Ensures only one request is tried at any time, preventing message re-ordering in case of retries.

If we have kafka >= 0.11
enable.idempotence=true (producer level) + min.insync.replicas=2 (broker/topic level)
    Implies acks=all, max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5, retries=max_INT (default)
    while keeping ordering guarantees and improving performance!

Running a "Safe Producer" might impact throughtput and latency, always use it to test your use case.
