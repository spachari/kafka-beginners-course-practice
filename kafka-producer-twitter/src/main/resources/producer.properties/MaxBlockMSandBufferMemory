Max.block.ms and buffer.memory

If the producer produces faster than the broker can take, the records will be buffered in memory.
An exception happens

This happens when
    The broker cannot ingest data fast enough
    Maybe the broker is overloaded
    We have not sized the broker properly
    There is a peak of usage of our applications

By default, each producer has a buffer memory of
buffer.memory=32MB: the size of the send buffer

That buffer will fill up over time and fill back down when the throughput to the broker increases
(when producer is able to send data to the broker in a faster way)

if the buffer is full (all 32MB is used), then the .send() method will start to block (wont return right away)
THis means that the code wont produce more data. It will just wait.

This wait is wait is set to

max.block.ms=60000; the time the send() will block until throwing an exception.

Exceptions are basically thrown when
    The producer has basically filled up it's buffer
    The broker is not accepting any new data
    60 seconds has elapsed

If you hit an exception hit that usually means your brokers are down or overloaded as they cannot respond to requests
The producers will go down as well until the brokers are recovered
