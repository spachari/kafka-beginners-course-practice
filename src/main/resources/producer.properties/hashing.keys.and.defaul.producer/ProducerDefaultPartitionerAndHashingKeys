Producer Default Partitioner and How keys are hashed

By default, your keys are hashed using the "murmur2" algorithm

It is most likely preferred to not override the behaviour of the partitioner, but it is possible to do so (partitioner.class)

The default formula is: (straight from kafka code)
targetParition = Utils.abs(Utils.murmur2(record.key())) % numParitions;

This means that same key will go to the same partition (we already know this), and adding partitions to a topic will
completely alter the formula

THis is why if we create a topic with (x number of partitions), we should not change the number of partitions
