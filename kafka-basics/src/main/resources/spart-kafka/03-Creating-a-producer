There was an issue starting kafka in my local. SO what I did was add these two lines to the server.properties file

port = 9092
advertised.host.name = localhost

then run kafka-console-producer via this

âžœ  kafka_2.12-2.4.0 sh bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
