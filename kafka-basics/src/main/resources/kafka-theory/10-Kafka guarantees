Kafka guarantees
    Messages are appended to a topic-partitions in the order they are sent
    Consumers read messages in the order stored in a topic partition
    With a replication factor of N, producers and consumers can tolerate of up to N-1 brokers being down
    This is why  replication factor of 3 is a good idea:
        Allows for ne broker to be taken down or maintenance
        Allows for another broker to be taken down unexpectedly

    As long as the number of partitions remain constant for a topic (no new partitions added), we can be sure that the same key will go to the same partition
