Consumers
    Consumers read data from topics (identified by name)
    Consumers know which broker to read from (they are programmed to read automatically)
    In case of broker failure, consumers know how to recover from a broker failure
    Data is read in order within each partitions
    (in order of offsets 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.... the consumer will not see offset 2 before it reads from offset 3)
    There is no guarantee of order between multiple partitions. Consumer reads data between partitions in parallel (each in order though). This is why specifying a key is immportant


Consumer Groups (an example would be a spark streaming application)
    Consumers read data in consumer groups
    Each consumer within a group reads from exclusive partitions
    If we have more consumers an partitions, then some of them will become inactive (this is not bad. it is better to have consumers sitting around doing nothing, because
    they will be standby. If any active consumer dies because of node shutdown, the standby consumer can take over)
    If we want to have a high number of consumers we have to have a high number of partitions. THis is a decision we have to make

Note: Consumers will automatically se a ConsumerCoordinator and a GroupCOordinator to assign consumers to a partition
