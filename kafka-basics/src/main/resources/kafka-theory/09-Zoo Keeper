Zookeepers
    Zookeeper manages a list of brokers (keeps a list of them)
    Zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions
    Zookeeper will send notifications to kafka n case of changes
        new topic created
        broker dies
        broker comes up
        delete topics

    kafka cannot work without zookeeper
    Zookeeper by design operates with odd number of rules (3,5,7). this means we will have 3,5, or 7 zoo keepers in production
    Zookeeper also has a leader (handle writes from the brokers) the rest of the servers are followers (handle reads) (Producers and consumers dont write to zoo keeper. They write to kafka.
    Kafka manages it's own metadata in zoo keeper)

    Zookeeper does not store consumer offsets. They are stored in a kafka topic. We will not be dealing with Kafka directly, we will be dealing with Kafka brokers
