Producers
Producers get data into Kafka.
    Producers write data to topics (which is made of partitions)
    Producers automatically know to which broker and partition to write to. We dont have to specify that
    (We just connect to kafka and producers will automatically know to which broker and partition to write to, we just mention the topic name
    and kafka will automatically get the broker and producer to write to)
    In case of broker failure, the producers automatically recover

When a Producer writes data to kafka brokers, it will automatically load balance and write a little bit to broker1, 2 3 and so on

Producer can choose to receive acknowledgements of data writes.
    acks=0 Producer wont wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss)
    acks=1 Producer will wait for the leader to acknowledge (limited data loss)
    acks=all Leader + all replicas acknowledgement (no data loss)

Producers can choose to send a key with a message (string, number etc)
If the key=null, then data will be sent round robin
If a key is mentioned, then all the messages for that key is sent to the same partition
A key is something we specify if we need message ordering or a specific field (guid, truck_id), even if the partition sends data late, we have
confirmation that all messages to this partition are in order
