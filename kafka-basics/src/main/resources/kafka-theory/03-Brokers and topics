Brokers
So what does hold the topic and partitions? A broker does
A kafka cluster comprises of multiple brokers. Each broker is basically a server.
    Each broker is identified by an ID
    Each broker contains certain topic partitions (but not all data)
    After connecting to any broker (called a bootstrap broker), we are connecting to the entire cluster

Brokers and Topics:
    When we create a topic, kafka will distribute it's partitions across multiple brokers
