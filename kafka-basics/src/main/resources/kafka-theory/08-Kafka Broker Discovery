Kafka Broker Discovery
    We mentioned that the Producer  can automatically figure out which broker they can send data to and Consumer can
    figure out which Broker to receive data from etc. THis is how it works

    Every Kafka broker is also called a "bootstrap server"
    That means that you will connect to only one broker and you will be connected to the entire Kafka cluster
    Each broker knows all about brokers, topics and partitions (metadata) (it does not hold the data, but it knows about which broker holds which topic at which partition)


So the way a client starts to connect a Broker is
    1. Connection + Metadata request (Client will connect to any broker and request the metadata (which partition lie in which broker))
    2. THe Broker will send a list of all Brokers and it's partitions
    3. Client will connect to the necessary broker

This is already implemented, not for us to worry about. But it is nice to know. When we have 100 brokers, we just need to connect to one broker and
the client is then smart enough to figure out which broker(s) to connect and get data from.
