Topic replication factor
Topics are usually replicated across multiple brokers. This way if a broker is down, another broker can serve the data
    Topics should have a replication factor > 1 (usually between 2 and 3) 3 is the gold standard. This means we have a true copy of this data in another Broker

Concept of a Leader in Partition
    At any time only one Broker can be a leader for a given partition
    Only that leader can and serve data for that partition
    The other brokers will synchronize data
    Therefore each partition has one leader nd multiple ISR (in sync replicas)

Who decides who can be the leader and assign a few ISRs - zoo keeper.
What happens when a broker goes down. There will be an election to decide which broker will be the next leader and it will take over.
When the leader comes back up it will take over from the ISR (all handled behind the scenes)
