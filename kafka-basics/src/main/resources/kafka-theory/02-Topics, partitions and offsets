Topics
A particular stream of data. It is the base of everything. It represents a particular stream of data.

    Similar to a table in a database (without any constraints)
    We can have as many Topics as we want
    A topic is identified by it's name (usually we name it by the stream of data)

Topic are split into partitions (we need to mention the number of partitions needed in a topic and we can change this later on )
    Each partition is ordered
    Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called offset


Note:
    Each partition will not have the same number of messages
    An offset 0 does notmean anything on it's own. It is usually kafka-topic(payment)-partition(partition0)-offset(0)

Topic example
    Say you have a fleet of trucks, each truck reports its GPS position to kafka
    You can have a topic truck_gps that contains the position of all trucks
    Each truck will send a message to Kafka every 20 seconds , each message will contain the truck id and truck location (latitude and longitude)
    We choose to create that topic with 20 partitions (arbitrary number)

    We may need it to create a location dashboard to track all our trucks or to create a notification service

Notes:
    Offset will have a meaning for a specific partition
        Offset 3 in partition1 will not have the the same data as Offset 3 in partition2
    Order is only guaranteed within a partition (not across partitions)
    Data in Kafka is only kept for a limited amount of time (default is one week)
    Once a data is written to a partition it cannot be changed (immutability)
    Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided
