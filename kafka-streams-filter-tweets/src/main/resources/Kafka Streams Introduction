You want to do the following tweets from the cricket_twitter_status_connect topic (the one we created for the kafka connect project)
    Filter only tweets that have over 10 likes or replicas
    Count the number of tweets received for each hashtag every 1 minute

    Or we want to combine the two and get trending topics and hashtags in real time!

With kafka Producer and Consumer, we can achieve this, but they are very low level and are not developer friendly

What is Kafka Streams

It is a java library for easy data processing and transformation library within kafka. It is typically used for (but not limited to)
    Data transformation
    Data enrichment
    Fraud detection
    Monitoring and Alerting

(In other words this is the core engine that can replace spark streaming)

It's advantages are
    1. It is a standard java application (it can run on the cluster itself)
    2. There is no need for a separate cluster
    3. Highly scalable, elastic, fault tolerant
    4. Exactly once capabilities
    5. One record at a time (because it is a simple java program). No micro batching like spark
    6. Works for any application size. It just scales like a consumer or producer.


history:

The API library was introduced as part of kafka 0.10 (2016) and it is fully mature as part of kafka 0.11 (2017)

It is the only library at the time of writing, can leverage the new exactly once capabilities from kafka 0.11

It is a serious contender to other processing frameworks such as Apache spark, flink and nifi

Active library, so it is always being enhanced


Example tweets Filtering

We want to filter a tweet topics and put the results back to kafka

We basically want to chain a consumer with a producer

Tweets topic -------> Consumer --------> Application Logic -------> Producer ------> Filtered Topic

This is extremely complicated and error prone, especially if we want to deal with concurrency and error scenarios
