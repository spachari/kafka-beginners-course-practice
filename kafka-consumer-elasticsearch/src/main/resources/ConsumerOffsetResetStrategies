Consumer Offset Reset Behaviour

A consumer is expected to read from a log continuously

But if your application has a bug, your consumer can be down.

If Kafka has a retention of 7 days and your consumer is down for more than 7 days, the offsets are invalid

How do we fix this?

The behaviour for the consumer is to then use:

    auto.offset.reset=latest; Will read from the end of the log
    auto.offset.reset=earliest; will read from the start of the log
    auto.offset.reset=none; will throw exception if no offset is found

Additionally, consumer offsets can be lost:
    If a consumer hasn't read new data in 1 day (Kafka < 2.0)
    If a consumer hasn't read new data in 7 days (Kafka >= 2.0)

This behaviour can be controlled by broker setting offset.retention.minutes and set it to high enough


Replaying data for Consumers

To repay data for a consumer group:
    Take all the consumers from a specific group down
    Use 'kafka-consumer-groups' command to set offset to what you want
    Restart consumers

Bottom line:
    Set proper data retention period (set it to 7 days or even a month) & offset retention period (same for data retention period)
    Ensure the auto reset behaviour (auto.offset.reset) is the one you expect/want (our examples are set to "earliest")
    Use replay capability in case of enexected behaviour
