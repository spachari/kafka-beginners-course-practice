It is common to have "generic" connectors or solutions to off-load data from Kafka to HDFS, Amazon s3 and Elastic Search for example

It is also common to have Kafka serve as a "speed layer" (used by Spark Streaming, Storm and flink) for real time applications to create
visits, alerts and Apps, while having a "slow layer" (Kafka Connect) to store data in HDFS, S# and Elastic Search which helps with data
ingestions into stores for alter analytics

Another primary application for Kafka is to collect application logs and application metrics. All applications can send logs and metrics
to Kafka to applicationLog topic and metircLog topic. Then these logs can be sent to Splunk using Kafka Connect for further analysis
