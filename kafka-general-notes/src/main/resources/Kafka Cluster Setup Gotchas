Kafka Cluster Setup Gotchas

    1. It is not easy to setup a kafka cluster
    2. You want to isolate the zoo-keeper and Broker on separate servers
    3. Monitoring needs to be implemented
    4. Operations need to be mastered.
    5. You really need a good kafka Admin.

    Alternative is, there are many different "Kafka as service" offerings on the web
    No operational burdens (Updates, monitoring, setup)
