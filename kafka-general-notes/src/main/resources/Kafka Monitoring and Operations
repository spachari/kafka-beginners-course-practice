Kafka monitoring and operations

    Kafka exposes metircs through JMX
    These metrics are highly important for monitoring kafka and ensuring the systems are behaving correctly under load
    Common places to host kafka metrics are
        ELK (Elastic Searcha + Kibana)
        DataDog
        NewRelic
        Confluent COntrol center
        Prometheus

    Some of the most important metrics are
        Under Replicated partitions - Number of parittions that have problems with ISR (in sync replicas). May indicate a
        high load on the system. If we have problems with ISR (under replicated partitions), it could be because the system has a high load
        or it is lagging, or one of your brokers are in stress or not working properly and we may ned to re-start it. SO monitoring the
        Under replicated partitions is really a good way to understand if the cluster is going well or not

        Requst Handlers - Utilization of threads for IO, network, etc... Overall utilization of the kafka broker. We need to monitor
        that these threads are not all busy at the same time. Otherwise we need to add CPU (threads) to kafka brokers to keep up

        Request timing - how long it takes to reply to requests. Lower the better, as latency will be improved.

Kafka operations team must be able to perform the following tasks:
    Rolling of brokers
    Updating Configurations
    Rebalancing partitions
    Increasing replication factor
    Adding a Broker
    Replacing a Broker
    Removing a Broker
    Upgrading a Kafka cluster with zero downtime
