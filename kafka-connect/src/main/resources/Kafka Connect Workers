Kafka Connect Workers
StandAlone Vs Distributed mode

StandAlone
    A single process runs your connectors and tasks
    Configuration is bundled with the process
    Very easy to get started with, used for development and testing
    Not fault tolerant, no Scalability, hard to monitor

Distributed
    Multiple workers run your connectors and tasks
    Configuration is submitted via REST API
    Easy to scale, fault tolerant (rebalancing in case a worker dies)
    Useful for production deployment of connectors

The rebalance is similar to what happens when consumers are down and other consumers pick the job
