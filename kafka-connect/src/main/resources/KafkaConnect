Do you feel like we are the first person to write a way to connect to twitter and get data from it?

De we feel we are the first person to find a way to send data from Kafka to PostgresSQL, ElasticSearch and MongoDB?

Additionally, the bugs we have someone else have already have fixed it for us!!!

Kafka connect to the rescue!! It's all about code and connectors re-use

Why Kafka Connect and Streams

There are only 4 common Kafka use cases:

1. Source => Kafka           ProducerAPI              (Kafka Connect Source)
2. Kafka => Kafka    Consumer API, ProducerAPI        (Kafka Streams)
3. Kafka => Sink             ConsumerAPI              (Kafka Connect Sink)
4. Kafka => App             ConsumerAPI

1. Simplify and improve getting data in and out of kafka
2. Simplify transforming data within Kafka without relying on external libs

Why Kafka Connect:
1. Programmers always want to import data from the same sources
    Databases
    JDBC
    CouchBase
    GoldenGate
    SAP HANA
    BlockChain
    DynamoDB
    Cassandra

2. Programmers always want to store data in the same sinks
    S3
    ElasticSearch
    JDBC
    MongoDB
    HBase
    DynamoDB
    Splunk
    Twitter

It is very tough to achieve fault tolerance, Idempotence, Distribution, Ordering

Other programmers may have already done a great job because they have faced the same challenges
and they might have open sourced their work

Kafka Connect - High Level

Source Connectors to get data from Common Data Sources

Target Connectors to publish data to Common Data Sources

Make it easy for non-experienced developers to quickly get their data relaiably into Kafka

part of your ETL Pipeline

Scaling made easy from small pipelines to company-wide pipelines

Re-usable code!!!

All the connectors are present in
https://www.confluent.io/product/connectors/

We are using this code to Kafka Connect to get data from twitter

https://github.com/jcustenborder/kafka-connect-twitter

Get the latest .tar and unzip and put the contents in your project (in a directory called connectors)

To run a connect-standalone we need a connect-standalone.properties file

➜  bin git:(master) ✗ ./connect-standalone.sh
USAGE: ./connect-standalone.sh [-daemon] connect-standalone.properties

go and get the connect-standalone.properties file from

/Users/spachari/Desktop/Kafka/kafka_2.12-2.2.0/config/connect-standalone.properties

and paste in our project root

Next create a file in the root folder called twitter.properties and paste them

name=TwitterSourceDemo
tasks.max=1
connector.class=com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.twitter.TwitterSourceConnector

# Set these required values

process.deletes=false
filter.keywords=ICC, Ben Stokes, Virat Kohli
kafka.status.topic=twitter_status_connect
kafka.delete.topic=twitter_deletes_connect

twitter.oauth.consumerKey=aPrGDjfv78kbpBPOp3RZ3BfMn
twitter.oauth.consumerSecret=beqczj0KiXhPkjIdEzaGBpO02t2hRRwXWhuYfzKaxkul5kwXHJ
twitter.oauth.accessToken=887022661888561152-uid3YP1nOButwerJpqJu8gAuDMsiFgS
twitter.oauth.accessTokenSecret=HOWe2jWTDZ37gfLct4LVAUZwCJHYhL688lo8QsgPmPp6G

Last is create the topics named twitter_status_connect and twitter_delete_connect

➜  bin git:(master) ✗ ./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic twitter_status_connect --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
WARNING: Due to limitations in metric names, topics with a period ('.') or underscore ('_') could collide. To avoid issues it is best to use either, but not both.
Created topic twitter_status_connect.
➜  bin git:(master) ✗ ./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic twitter_deletes_connect --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
WARNING: Due to limitations in metric names, topics with a period ('.') or underscore ('_') could collide. To avoid issues it is best to use either, but not both.
Created topic twitter_deletes_connect.
➜  bin git:(master) ✗

we can see them all here

➜  bin git:(master) ✗ ./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --list
__consumer_offsets
first_topic
new_topic
newly_topic
second_topic

twitter_deletes_connect
twitter_status_connect

start the consumer for twitter_status_connect
➜  bin git:(master) ✗ ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic twitter_status_connect --from-beginning
