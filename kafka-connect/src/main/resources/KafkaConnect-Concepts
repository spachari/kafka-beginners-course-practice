Kafka Connect cluster has multiple loaded Connectors
    Each connector is a re-usable piece of java code
    many connectors exist in the open source world, so leverage them

Connectors + User Configurations => Tasks
    A task is linked to a connector configuration
    A job configuration may spawn multiple tasks

Tasks are executed by kafka connect workers (servers)
    A worker is a single java process
    A worker can be standalone or in a cluster
